### 2.3. Usage
#### Project structure:
- ```WetPart.ipynb``` - Jupiter notebook includes all the code and the results of the traffic analysis. The notebook includes the following main things:
  - Importing the required packages and reading the pcap file as CSV
  - Plotting the raw data of the user traffic analysis (packet length in bytes by time in seconds)
  - Plotting PDF of delay between packets arrival time.
  - Plotting CCDF of message sizes normalized by the maximum message size. There are 4 lines, each line represents a different IM group.
  - Comparing the traffic graphs of a confirmed member (correlated) and a non-member (uncorrelated) in the IM group.
- ```res``` - Folder contains the outcome graphs generated by the notebook.
- ```resources``` - Folder contains the pcap files and the csv files generated from the pcap files.
